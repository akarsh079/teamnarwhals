                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello, I'm Sriya Neti, a junior at American High School. I'm passionate about learning, exploring new topics, and working on various projects. In my free time, I enjoy reading, spending time with my friends, walking my dog, and watching TV and movies. When I'm not doing these things you will find me studying. I'm excited for this school year and the next, though I'm sad to be leaving high school very soon. </p>
